I'm a PhD student at <a href="http://www.ilcc.inf.ed.ac.uk/">ILCC</a> of the <a href="http://www.ilcc.inf.ed.ac.uk/">School of Informatics</a> at <a href="http://www.ilcc.inf.ed.ac.uk/">The University of Edinburgh</a>. My supervisor is <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/">Shay Cohen</a>. My research focuses on Machine Learning techniques for Natural Language Processing. My long-term goal is to help make AI a reality. The goal of AI is to make intelligent machines, where we define intelligence the ability to undertake the cognitive activities humans naturally do. Language is certaiinly one of those.
