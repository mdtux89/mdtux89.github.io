<p>Applied Scientist in Amazon Cambridge, working on Natural Language Processing. I recently finished a PhD at <a href="http://www.ilcc.inf.ed.ac.uk/">ILCC</a> of the <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics">School of Informatics</a> at <a href="http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/">The University of Edinburgh</a>, with <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/">Shay Cohen</a>.</p> 
<p>My main research interest is in NLP. The goal of Artificial Intelligence (beside inspiring sci-fi movies) is to make intelligent machines, where we define intelligence as the ability to undertake the cognitive activities humans naturally do. Language is certainly one of those.</p>

<p>In my PhD, I investigated the use of Abstract Meaning Representation (<a href="https://amr.isi.edu">AMR</a>) for language understanding (NLU; natural language -> semantic representation) and generation (NLG; semantic representation -> natural language). I developed an AMR parser (NLU) that can process multiple languages (<a href="http://cohort.inf.ed.ac.uk/amreager.html">AMREager</a>) as well as a AMR-to-text generation system (NLG) for English (<a href="http://cohort.inf.ed.ac.uk/amrgen.html">AMRGen</a>). If you feel brave, you can use them in a pipeline to perform AMR-based Machine Translation :) I also developed a set of metrics to perform fine-grained evaluation of AMR parsers (<a href="http://cohort.inf.ed.ac.uk/amr-evaluation.html">AMREval</a>).</p>
