<p>I'm a PhD student at <a href="http://www.ilcc.inf.ed.ac.uk/">ILCC</a> of the <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics">School of Informatics</a> at <a href="http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/">The University of Edinburgh</a>. My supervisor is <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/">Shay Cohen</a>.</p> 
<p>My main research interest is in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal of Artificial Intelligence (beside inspiring sci-fi movies) is to make intelligent machines, where we define intelligence as the ability to undertake the cognitive activities humans naturally do. Language is certainly one of those.</p>

<p>My PhD focuses on investigating Natural Language Understanding (NLU) with Abstract Meaning Representation (<a href="https://amr.isi.edu">AMR</a>). Semantic parsing, a vibrant area in natural language processing, aims at carrying out the difficult task of canonicalizing language and represent its meaning: given a natural language sentence, we want to retrieve its meaning. We use AMR as a meaning representation. AMR and other semantic formalisms have the potential to transform traditional NLP problems such as Machine Translation, Question & Answering and Summarization as well as allowing us to define new and unanticipated NLP applications.</p>
