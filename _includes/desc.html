<p>I'm a PhD student at <a href="http://www.ilcc.inf.ed.ac.uk/">ILCC</a> of the <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics">School of Informatics</a> at <a href="http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/">The University of Edinburgh</a>. My supervisor is <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/">Shay Cohen</a>.</p> 
<p>My research focuses on Machine Learning techniques for Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal of Artificial Intelligence (beside inspiring cool sci-fi movies) is to make intelligent machines, where we define intelligence the ability to undertake the cognitive activities humans naturally do. Language is certainly one of those, which is way I'm interested in NLP.</p>

<p>My PhD focuses on researching fast and accurate Semantic Parsing with Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR). Semantic parsing, a vibrant area in natural language processing, aims at carrying out the difficult task of canonicalizing language and represent its meaning: given a natural language sentence, we want to retrieve its meaning. Once fast and precise parsers will be available, AMR and other semantic formalisms will have the potential to drastically transform traditional NLP problems such as Machine Translation, Knoweledge Representation, Question and Answering and Summarization as well as allowing us to define new and unanticipated NLP applications.</p>
